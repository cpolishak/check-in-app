# Self Check in app
A quickly built self check in app. 

I created this to prep for an interview, but this could be another fun side-project to work on to learn and display some Software Engineering skills. It's just getting started and could be built out to be quite robust in the future.

## Things it would need to have

### Select patient (if haven't before now)
- May be needed when checking in for another patient (ex: a kid)

### Current info - Verify or Update
- Address
- Email
- Emergency Contacts

### Verification of insurance page
- Select insurance on file
- Or enter new insurance to be submitted to back end and or validated

### Patient History 
- Do you have any of the following conditions
- Do you have a family history of these conditions
   - Which family member if so

### Selecting Pharmacy
- Choose on file or add new
- Probably needs maps integration (googleAPI)

### Summary Page - confirmation of details 
- Have list of main details for user to review prior to completing check-in
   - What criteria should be shown here?

### Testing for all kinds of stuff
- Need to test components to ensure functioning properly
- Would need validations wherever needed
- Smoke testing to find edge cases
- and more... (to be dealt with later)
